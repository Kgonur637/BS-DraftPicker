# BS-DraftPicker
A program that gives draft information for BS.

You need to have a way to screen share your phone with Brawl Stars to the PC you will use for this program. For Android to Windows/Linux, I recommend looking up "SCRCPY".
This program has a list of Python library requirements, but on top of that you will need to download Tesseract to use the PyTessaract library.

You will also need to add this to your path.
I'm not smart enough to explain how to do this so just look up "Adding Tesseract OCR to Path". 
Note that this program has only been tested on Windows machines, as one of the libraries is windows only. 
You will also need to create a folder with the draft images in them, and name it "SpenLC" (or change that name in the code). Place this folder in the same location as the python program.
