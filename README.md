# BS-DraftPicker
A program that gives draft information for BS.

You need to have a way to screen share your phone with Brawl Stars to the PC you will use for this program. For Android to Windows/Linux, I recommend looking up "SCRCPY".
This program has a list of Python library requirements, but on top of that you will need to download Tesseract to use the PyTessaract library.

You will also need to add this to your path.
I'm not smart enough to explain how to do this so just look up "Adding Tesseract OCR to Path". 
Please don't use automatic calibration, 99% of the time won't work. 
Note that this program has only been tested on Windows machines. I have no idea how to make them work on MacOS. I'm sure if you use Linux you don't need this program.
